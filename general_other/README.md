
Further project ideas (John's ideas of how to spend free time..):

- Generative Naive Bayes for song lyrics of 2 different artists; make some new fake songs in the style of their lyrics
- Compare the above with Hidden Markov Model approach
- RandomForest from scratch
- n-dimensional model interpretation: search for maximum clustering of classes + distance between clusters for plotting most useful dimensions
- clustering of multiple bands into genres, find "bridge" artists... likely involve PCA
- RL: learn how to play backgammon
- Implement optimization/simulation using monte carlo method or pyomo or something similar
- commute times
- predict nfl outcomes better than the spread
- clustering for national anthem lyrics, compare these to attributes (government types, geography, historical...)
