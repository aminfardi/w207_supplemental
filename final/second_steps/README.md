# Second stage of modeling efforts

### Pipeline status
* All raw code for filtering is in `preprocess_pipeline_rawcode.ipynb`
* Functions for pipelined filtering + feature generation are in `pipeline_fxn.ipynb`
  * sample output files are in `testcsv` directory
  * __PLEASE__ save any generated data frame outside this repository or include them in a folder that you can put in `.gitignore`. No need for us to have the same thing saved a ton of times :)

### Sampling Method Status
* TODO (John): write function
* TODO (John): incorporate into `pipeline_fxn.ipynb`
