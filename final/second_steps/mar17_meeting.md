# Next steps modeling (3/17/19)

- Baseline for error with mean/median... this will help show how good our models actually are (Hong)
- Creation of campaign runtime feature (campaigns needed) (Amin)
- Payman to figure out... what did I do?!?! (Payman)
- Decision on feature selection: 
  - keep all temperatures (done)
  - keep missing value filtering as-is (done)
  - Scaling of features: pipeline this for different possibilities for those that need it: not-scaled, standardScaler, minMax (John)
  - ML algorithms: linear regression, tree-based (boosted trees, randomForest, Decision Tree), knn (?), neural network (all... mostly Payman)
  
- Sampling procedure for extreme points (John)
- Data processing pipeline (John)

- John + Amin to have this by end of week hopefully

- All to use joint_exploration as reference

- Model interpretation (TBD)

- Deadline of 4/7/19 for next meeting
