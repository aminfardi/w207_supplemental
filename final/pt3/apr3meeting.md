* Modeling is more or less completed
* Focusing in on randomForest, XGRegressor

* __Variable Importance__: for both models
  * Standard information gain feature importance (standard method call from sklearn) and discussion
  * Permutation variable importance and discussion
  * Random Forest only: stability of results from individual tree prediction (standard deviation of predictions)

* __Final Notebook__:
  * Condensed EDA (Hong)
      * Show visuals from EDA, and resulting pipeline functions
  * Condensed ML + visuals (Payman)
    * table of results, code for things that were run, visuals (y vs y predicted, etc)
  * Final models + importance (random forest + XGRegressor)
    * Random Forest (Amin)
    * XGRegressor (John)

Tentative next meeting: Sunday April 14
