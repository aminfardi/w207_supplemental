# Final Project W207 Spring 2019
* Project team: Amin Fardi, Hong Yang, Payman Roghani, John Boudreaux

### CONTENTS
* Initial problem setup, EDA, and brief PCA analysis (`joint_explotation.ipynb`)
* ML algorithm fitting, based on all the data pipeline setups in `/p_data` (`model_selection_analysis.ipynb`)
* Random Forest Model Interpretation (`RandomForest Model Interpretation.ipynb`)
* XGBoost Model Interpretation (`xgboost_importance.ipynb`)
* Model permutation importance comparison (`Model permutation importance comparison.pdf`)
* Raw Data (`anonymized_SAP_Data.csv`)
* Pipeline function for generalized data preprocessing, scaling, feature generation, sampling that created all the files in `/p_data` (`pipeline fxn_PR.ipynb`)
* Folder of all possible outputs of data preprocessing pipelines (`/p_data`)
* Various image files used in `model_selection_analysis.ipynb`

### PROBLEM
* Model a lab-measured `Quality` variable based on sensor measurements in a chemical manufacturing process
